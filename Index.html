          <br> 
          <p> This classic recipe is for lazy summer days that beg for moving slowly and snacking often. Chop tomatoes, place them in a colander, shower them with salt, <br> 
            then make yourself a drink or go for a swim. The longer they drain, the better they’ll be. This bruschetta gets better as it sits for a bit, so make it up to an hour <br> 
            ahead. While most bruschetta recipes have you rub a raw garlic clove on toasted bread, this one calls for making a quick infused oil that’s stirred into the tomatoes <br> 
            and basil, providing a more delicate garlicky note. Pile it all on toasted bread, and enjoy bite after juicy bite.</p>

        <h4> Ingredients </h4>
          <ul> 
            <li> 1 pound of plum tomatoes (about 4 to 5 large), or another variety of ripe tomatoes </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon kosher salt </li>
            <li> 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil </li>
            <li> 2 large garlic cloves (minced) </li>
            <li> 8 large basil leaves </li>
            <li> Grilled or toasted crusty bread (for serving) </li>
          </ul>
        <h5> Preparation </h5>
          <ol> 
            <li> Core and chop the tomatoes, then transfer to a colander over a bowl or in the sink. Add the salt and gently stir. Let drain for up to 2 hours. </li>
            <li> Meanwhile, make the garlic oil: In a small saucepan, warm the olive oil and garlic over low heat until the garlic is softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes, <br> 
                making sure the garlic doesn’t brown. Set aside to cool. </li>
            <li> Roll the basil leaves up and thinly slice crosswise. </li>
            <li> When the oil is cool and the tomatoes are well drained, combine the tomatoes, garlic oil and basil in a medium bowl. Season with additional salt, to taste. <br> 
                Spoon over toasted bread. </li>
          </ol>
